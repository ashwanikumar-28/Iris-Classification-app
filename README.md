#  Iris Flower Classification App
This is a simple Machine Learning web application that classifies Iris flowers into **Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica** species based on user inputs.  
The model is trained using the famous **Iris dataset** and implemented with **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm**.

# Features
- Classifies Iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.
- Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**.
- Easy to deploy and run locally.
